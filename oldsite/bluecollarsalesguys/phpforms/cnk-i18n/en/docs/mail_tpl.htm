You can create templates which will be pre-populated with the values submitted 
by users. These submissions are sent to the email address specified in the 
<b>Send to email</b> field (in the properties of the form) or to the address 
specified in the email field.<br>
<br>
Two types of tags are available: tags associated with forms and tags not 
associated with forms:<br>

1.	Tags not associated with forms: <br>
-	[form-name] is replaced by the form name <br>
-	[form-data] is replaced by the list "field-name :: field data"<br>
-	[ip-address] is replaced by user's IP-address<br>
<br>
2.	Tags associated with forms:<br>
-	[field-name#431bf861b7.b9d0be6e80#] is the name of a field<br>
-	[field-data#431bf861b7.b9d0be6e80#] is the value of the field<br>
<br>
Select the form from the drop-down list of forms, and select the field from 
the list <b>Page.Field - Field name</b>. Click <b>Name</b> or <b>Data</b> at 
the bottom. This will insert the tag of the name or the field value into the 
template.
<br>
It is recommended that you use these templates for the forms which contain 
the fields that were used.<br>
You should create templates when the form is completed.
