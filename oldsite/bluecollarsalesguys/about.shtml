        <h1 align="left">The <span class="italic"> Guys'</span> Story</h1>
				<p align="justify">Once upon a time in a saloon far, far away a rare event took place as a few sales guys settled down to enjoy a couple of &quot;barley pops&quot;...ok so maybe it really wasn't that rare. Eventually the topic of conversation came around to how all of their client companies kept complaining about how sales training had just become an unproductive waste of time for their sales teams.</p>
				<p align="justify">Theoretical sell-o-babble training centered on learning how to discover your inner self, or connect with the outer-pain of your prospect based on therapeutic group hugs. <span class="italic">What is that?</span></p>
				<p align="justify">Or, the sales trainers in cheap suits shouting motivational slogans over and over, beating you into submission, only to discover you then have to purchase their SECRET sales system for $3,799 to even get out of the meeting room! <span class="italic">Ugh!</span></p>
				<p align="justify">Or, how about the droning on and on and on by Professor E.Z. Sales - who's last real world sales experience was working a lemonade stand he had when he was in Kindergarten. <span class="italic">Boring!</span></p>
				<p align="justify"><span class="bold">That was it - </span>with a stack of entrepreneur planning forms (napkins) and another round for Stuart and friends, the <a href="index.shtml" class="bold">Blue Collar Sales Guys</a> were born.</p>

Straight talk: no B.S., just simple sales techniques that everyone can do. And, presented in a fun and interesting way so participants want to listen, with easy-to-remember tools that can be used the minute you walk out the door. </p>
				<p align="justify"><span class="underline">Measurable Results:</span> the sales training would need to provide proven ideas that really work in today's challenging market. Above all, it would need to be a sales training program that can be customized to the needs and participants to be truly effective...and, oh, did I mention, it had to be FUN!</p>
				<p align="justify">With a combined record of over 30 years of successful and leading goal busting sales teams, Stuart launched the program designed just for you and guaranteed to  - <a href="toolbox.shtml"><span class="bold">"UP YOUR SALES!"</span></a></p>
