			Hospitality Rocks! events are for any business owner, manager or staff who 
			oversees those responsible for bringing hospitality to the customer. 
			We believe a work environment filled with negative thoughts keeps 
			everyone from achieving their potential. At one of our events we'll 
			teach you how to harness positive energy and make your team 
			<b>Rockstars!</b> through improvement opportunities such as: 
			<ul>
				<li>Unique and positive strategies for improving hospitality</li>
				<li>Techniques for growing your revenue</li>
				<li>Workbooks, eBooks, check-up emails</li>
			</ul>
			Working on your business instead of in it will give you a chance to 
			improve your business through a more effective approach and allow you
			to celebrate your results later on!
