		<p><h4>Quotes from Live Events</h4>
			<ul style="font-style: italic;">
				<li>&quot;Think about your team right now... 
				What would happen to that team if you 
				lost one of your stars?&quot;</li><br>
				<li>&quot;Each person’s destiny is not a matter of chance,
				it’s a matter of choice. It is determined by what we say, 
				what we do and whom we trust.&quot;</li><br>
				<li>&quot;I think I can, I think I can, I think I 
				can... The little train that could. Who’s the author? 
				Watty Piper...Here’s my test to all of you; You probably 
				have that book at home if you have children.  
				It’s in their room or it’s in a box in their 
				closet.  Pull it out and read that in your 
				next pre-shift. “I think I can, I think I can, 
				I think I can.”  It’s all about belief.&quot;</li><br>
				<li>&quot;Whether you think you can or you think 
				you can’t you’re absolutely right. -Henry Ford.&quot;</li><br>
				<li>&quot;We have to look at our people like they’re what?  
				Rock stars, service stars, they’re the best.&quot;</li>
			</ul>
