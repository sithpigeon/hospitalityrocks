		<b>Service is the cornerstone</b> of every business in America and at one of our
		ServiceRocks! speaking events you will discover how to create Service that ROCKS!
		The real differentiator in businesses today is how the customer is treated,
		and we are all excited to improve that experience. At ServiceRocks! we believe that:
			<ul>
				<li>To Serve is to Rule, get out of their way.</li>
				<li>Take your team on the magical mystery tour.</li>
				<li>Anyway you want it, we will deliver results.</li>
			</ul>
			
		
		</p>
		<p>
		How you see your team is how they see your customers and guests. Our highly interactive 
		audience centric sessions will show you real world examples of how your actions affect your
		team and what you learn will significantly impact your results. Think about:
			<ul>
				<li>How to recognize those on your team that ROCK!</li>
				<li>What ROCKSTAR Service really means.</li>
				<li>How to connect with everyone on your team.</li>
				<li>The true value of a challenging customer.</li>
			</ul>
		Remember, the frontline guest interaction is what enhances your bottomline. Amp up your customer 
		service and put more money in the bank (you will have more fun too)!
